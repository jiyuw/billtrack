## Docker Deployment

### Unraid / Dockhand (Recommended)

This repository is designed to publish a production image to GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main`.

- Image: `ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:latest`
- Stable branch tag: `ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:main`
- Immutable build tags: `ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:sha-<commit>`

For Dockhand or any other GitOps-style deploy tool, prefer **pulling the published image** instead of syncing the repo and rebuilding locally.

Recommended Dockhand flow:

1. Point your app at `ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:latest`
2. Enable image pull / refresh on update
3. Restart or recreate the container when a new image is detected
4. Keep `/app/data` mounted so the SQLite database persists across deploys

This is more reliable than GitHub repo sync for this app, because the running container serves the built SvelteKit output, not the raw repository contents.

### Using Docker Compose

1. Pull and start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. View logs:

```bash
docker logs billzzz
```

4. Stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Using Docker directly

1. Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:latest
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name billzzz \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/jiyuw/billzzz:latest
```

### Building Locally

If you want to build the image yourself instead of using GHCR:

```bash
docker build -t billzzz:local .
docker run -d --name billzzz -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data billzzz:local
```

### Data Persistence

The SQLite database is stored in the `./data` directory, which is mounted as a volume. Your data will persist even if the container is stopped or removed.

**Note:** The `./data` directory will be created automatically with the appropriate permissions when you first run the container.

## Development
